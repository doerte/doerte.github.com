I recently finished my PhD in Neurolinguistics at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands.
You can find more information about my PhD research under ['current project'] (/Research/current)!  
     
     
Besides my work on the multimodality of speech comprehension (especially in aphasia) I am also generally interested in research on 
language comprehension, aphasia and the remediation of aphasia.  
  
   
Under ['Previous Projects'] (/Research/previous) you can find information about my diploma thesis investigating the efficacy of a treatment program!  

If you are interested in participating in one of my studies please check [this site] (/Research/subj) for more information about ongoing studies.
