I just incorporated a blog into my website. This blog is (just as the website) hosted by [GitHub](http://github.com)
and using [jekyll](http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll/). I will post entries on a non-regular basis, whenever I feel
that something should be posted. More regular, though short, updates can be found in my Twitter feed, also on 
my blog.

So come back regularly to check whether there are any news.
