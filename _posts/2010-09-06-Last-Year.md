Today is my first official working day in my last year as a PhD candidate...


First of all I have to say it is unbelievable how fast 3 years can go by, I really feel like I just started. But, I didn't. 
So today is the day "the end" starts. Lots and lots of writing to be done, luckily also still some testing and analyzing, 
just to keep a healthy balance. I now have a schedule for the upcoming year, with the first deadline for a chapter already passed...
Luckily the chapter is also done. Next deadline is the end of october for two chapters: one on the theoretical background and
one about my identification experiment. So that means I'll focus on those two things during the upcoming two months, next to 
running the ERP experiment with some more patients and analyzing the results of it. Busy weeks ahead of me, but I'm still quite
optimistic to manage my own deadlines.


Now it's time to have some cake with colleagues who just had their birthdays, seems like a good way to start "the end"...
