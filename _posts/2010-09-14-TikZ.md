Everything started with me wanting one of my diagrams to be more beautiful. I googled a lot
and eventually found that TikZ would solve my one specific problem. So I installed the package
and put the manual on my desktop (I need access as fast as possible). Soon I got the diagram
I wanted and was amazed on how nice it looked. It really does matter if the font and style fit
with the remaining document! 

So I decided that I should change all my diagrams to TikZ-diagrams (at least the ones not made 
with R, which already look very nice). It cost me quite some time and work, but once I saw
the result I knew it was worth it. But... there was still one diagram I was hesitating to change.
It took me quite some time to make it with dia and I was afraid of the time it would cost to 
redo it with TikZ, but eventually I surrendered to my urge to have not 'all-but-one', but rather 'all'
diagrams in a nice style. Some hours later I was done and below you can see the result (click the image to see it bigger)...

And here's the Latex-code I used... I know, it's much less than perfect - TikZ offers a lot of more
advanced features to deal with all the repetitions, but for now that's it, plain and simple (and long):
