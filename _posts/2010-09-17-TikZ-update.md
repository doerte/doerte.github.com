Ok, I admitted in the last [post](../../14/TikZ) that my TikZ diagram was a lot less than optimal, because of too many 
repetitions in the code. So I decided to spend some time with the TikZ manual (really useful source of information), 
with the result that I learned about 'for-loops': For everything that needs to be carried out more than 1 time, a for-loop 
can be used. 

The concept is quite simple: In the follwing example an "ultra thick" line is drawn for a certain point \x from -6 to -6.5 on the y-axis. This
is done for each of the points specified.


<pre id="latex"><code>
\foreach \x in {0.35,1.54,2.73,3.92,5.11,6.3} \draw[ultra thick] (\x,-6) -- (\x,-6.5);
</code></pre>


This however can be simplified even more. Just mention the first 2 and the last of the desired points and the ones in between 
can be replaced with "...", as below.

<pre id="latex"><code>
\foreach \x in {0.3,1.54,...,6.3} \draw[very thick] (\x,-6) -- (\x,-6.5);
</code></pre>

The complete picture looks just like the one before, the only difference is that I added some more connection lines, because it became so 
much easier. Also I changed the coordinates slightly, to improve the size of the final picture. Now it perfectly matches the text width in the 
document I use it in. If you want to see a bigger picture you can click on it!

And again the Latex-code I used...:
