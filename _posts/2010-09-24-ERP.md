Part of my work as a PhD candidate consists of measuring and 
analyzing brain waves. We do this by conducting so-called "ERPs", i.e. 
"event-related potentials". We record the EEG (Electroencephalogram)
of participants and timelock it to stimuli, the events. In order to get only
the information relevant for the stimulus a lot of repetitions are necessary.
The brain waves of all those repetitions are then averaged, which filters out 
the "noise" as this is random and leaves only the constant reaction to our stimulus.

As you can read on my ["current project" site] (http://doerte.eu/research/current)
I am interested in the perception of speech sounds in individuals with aphasia,
an acquired language disorder. In my experiment the participants are asked to 
listen to a sequence of syllables with standard and deviant sounds. On encountering 
a deviant sound they should push a button.

However when I have my data I'm facing some problems:
