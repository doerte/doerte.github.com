So, another year... 2011 has just started and while I enjoyed its first 
days in the Dolomites, I'm not back at work. This year will be rather 
busy,with hopefully 2 papers to publish, 1 conference to visit and 
of course a Thesis to finish.

But before I can get back to that full-time I'm also still writing on
a German paper for the proceedings of a symposium I attended
in November. However I noticed that writing in German is not that 
easy. I'm so used to writing papers and abstracts in English that my 
German writing really degraded. Next to that I also never talk about
research topics in German anymore, I discuss my findings and ideas
in English and in Dutch with my colleagues, but never in German.
So one way or the other my native language is the most difficult 
for me right now.
