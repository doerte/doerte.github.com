In order to inform also friends and family that are not Neurolinguists about my research, I planned a layman's talk in the morning.  
    
  In this short lecture I will try to present my research in a way that is understandable for the general public.

  <table width="401" border="0">
    <tr>
      <td width="84">Time:</td>
      <td width="307">Thursday, Dcember 15th 2011, 10:30-11:00</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Place:</td>
      <td>Room A2 in the Academy Building</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
